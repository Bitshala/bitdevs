# Bitshala Bitdevs

Bitdevs are topic-specific technical discussions on Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr, organised by Bitshala, and are open to all for participation.

Each session focuses on a specific topic, with a topic-specific expert as a guest for the session. Participants are expected to ask questions and engage in an interactive learning session with the expert.

Bitdev Sessions are recorded and can be found on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr0NjyrHtkw1okNJJ-guqbg) for future reference.
