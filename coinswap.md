# Summary
Coinswap, an atomic swap protocol built on Bitcoin using Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs), predates Lightning as one of the earliest on-chain protocols incorporating HTLCs. Greg Maxwell introduced the concept in 2013 on a Bitcoin Talk [forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0).

Despite its conceptualization, the protocol remained unimplemented for years, mainly due to perceived complexities.

In 2020, Chris Belcher took the initiative to develop the first prototype, documented in this [repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions).

Unfortunately, development ceased in July 2022 due to adverse physical conditions resulting from Long-Covid. Subsequently, other contributors resumed the project from where Belcher left off, now hosted in this [new repository](https://github.com/utxo-teleport/teleport-transactions).
