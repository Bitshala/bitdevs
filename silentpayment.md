# Summary

Silent payments build on concepts like BIP47, which allows individuals to create reusable payment codes that can be tweaked by others to create unique public addresses that only the sender and receiver are aware of. This allows the receiver to accept bitcoin in a more private fashion when compared to exposing a xpub or simply reusing a single address to receive payments. It removes the need for a notification transaction entirely by leveraging the outputs in a transaction to signal to the recipient when funds are intended for them.
